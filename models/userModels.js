// Some other powerful features of mongoose:

/*
5. Object Mapping & Virtuals
Mongoose: Provides virtual fields and object mapping, allowing you to create calculated fields or virtual fields that donâ€™t get persisted in the database but are computed on-the-fly.
Example:
js
Copy code
userSchema.virtual('fullName').get(function() {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
});
MongoDB Native Driver: No such concept exists. You would need to manually calculate these fields in your application.
6. Population (References & Joins)
Mongoose: Provides a feature called population, which allows for easy referencing and fetching of related documents (similar to SQL joins). This is very handy when you have relationships between different collections.
Example:
js
Copy code
User.findOne({ _id: userId }).populate('posts').exec((err, user) => {
  console.log(user.posts);
});
MongoDB Native Driver: No such concept exists. You would need to manually populate these fields in your application.
